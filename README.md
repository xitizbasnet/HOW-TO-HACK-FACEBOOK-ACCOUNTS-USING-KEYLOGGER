HOW TO HACK FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS USING KEYLOGGER


STEP 1: Create Server for Hacking Passwords

First of all, for hacking any Facebook account password, we have to create our keylogger server that will run on the victim’s machine, capturing his keystrokes and emailing us the record. The keylogger server building process consists of several steps:

1. First of all download the Keylogger and a good binder. Binders are easily available via a Google search. 

2. Extract the RAR file. Now you will get one folder and three files.

3. Open the Keylogger file. Here you will need a gmail ID and password. For safer use, create a fake Gmail account.

4. Click on server settings as shown. Here, enter the time at which you want to receive reports; it’s always preferable to use a 20 minute timer for receiving files. Click on the Output box to choose the location of the file and give it a name. We recommend using a system process name to make it undetectable, like svchost, or check any process name from your task manager and name it. Other fields are optional.

5. Click on Log and Result Setting. In Log Email Title enter the subject of email like “my keylogger report” or anything else that you you like. Click the last two options that add computer name and add the victim’s name.

6. Now click on “Other Options.” In this section you just have to do one thing. Most hackers prefer warning message POP up, but I prefer keylogger using any message – so unclick the message button. When you bind it with any other software it should not have a warning message attached, otherwise it will be detectable.

7. Finally click on Build Keylogger. You will see your keylogger file at the location that you have chosen in the 4th step. This keylogger server file will be used to bind with other software in Binding Step.

 8. Now your keylogger server is ready for you to hack Facebook accounts. 


Step 2: Extracting the icon file from any installer (resource hacker)

1. Open the resource hacker folder and select the reshacker file.

2. Go to its menu and open any setup file. Suppose we want to attach our keylogger to a Ccleaner setup file. Open the Ccleaner setup with resource hacker. 

3. In the menu, there is one action button. Click on it and then click save all resource.

 4. Save all the resources to the desktop or any other location of your choice.

5. It consists of two files. One is icon file and other is res file. We only need the icon file, so you can delete the other one.

6. That leaves us with the icon of installer file (Ccleaner setup icon).

Step 3: Bind the Keylogger server with any software

1. Go to keylogger folder and open the Binder.

2. Click on the button shown below to add files.

3. Add the keylogger server and the setup software (in our case it’s Ccleaner setup).

4. In the Binder menu, go to Settings. There, select the icon that we have generated in the previous step and set the location of the output file as shown in the figure.

5. Now again go to file’s menu in Binder and click on Bind files.

6. Now your Binded keylogger is ready. You just need to spread it or send it to the victim that is your friend.

Step 4: How to spread the keylogger

1. Now you have one software setup file with a keylogger attached to it. (In our case, we have Ccleaner setup with keylogger attached with it)

2. Spread your keylogger through forums. If you are a member of various forums, use them to spread your keylogger in the form of software posts.

3. Spread it through pendrives or USB hard drives. Suppose a friend asked you for a software, give them the software with the keylogger attached to it on the hard drive. 

Note: you can also attach keyloggers to images, but that can be detectable by antivirus, so we recommend avoiding that route.

Hacking someone’s Facebook account takes more than a few minutes.
